# Rest Server Template
It's a basic Express Rest Server without DataBase

The server logic is created with classes for ease of use. It can be found in models/servers.js
From there we will be able to manage both server and routes and middlewares. 

In the routes folder we will add the routes. user.js is the one we have as an example.

In the controllers folder we will add all the controller functions.
